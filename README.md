Path Planning

## Approaches to Path Planning
Three different approaches:

* `Discrete (or combinatorial) path planning`
* `Sample-based path planning`
* `Probabilistic path planning`

## Discrete Planning
Discretize the robot’s workspace into a connected graph, and apply a graph-search algorithm to calculate the best path. It is very computationall very expensive. Therefore, it is best suited for low-dimensional problems. For high-dimensional problems, sample-based path planning is a more appropriate approach.
